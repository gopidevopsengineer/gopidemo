
Setting Up Tomcat
My setup.bat file
(Again your Enviroment Variables should be set as below. I just use this .bat
to run a copy of Tomcat on a flash drive, hence the %1 parameter, The drive letter is always different.)


SET CLASSPATH=.;%1:\Java\jre1.8\lib\ext\*;%1:\Tomcat\lib\*;
SET PATH=.;%1:\Java\jdk1.8\bin;%PATH%;
SET JAVAHOME=%1:\Java\jdk1.8
SET JRE_HOME=%1:\Java\jre1.8
SET CATALINA_HOME=%1:\Tomcat

My tomcat-users.xml file in Tomcat\conf
You need this to get to the manager.

    <user username="tomcat1" password="tomcat1" roles="admin-gui,admin-script"/>
    <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx" />
</tomcat-users>

In fact, this is overkill you could start with:

<tomcat-users>
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/>
</tomcat-users>

To check errors etc. use the Tomcat Window below or look at the appropriate catalina and localhost logs in Tomcat\logs
Start Up

Using the Tomcat Window -- I didn't put the MySQL driver .jar file
in Tomcat\lib .
To fix the runtime error, I copied it from my Java\jre1.8\lib\ext and restarted Tomcat
